## Usage

### Customizing Data

You can customize the initial chips shown in the bucket by modifying the `INITIAL_CHIPS` array:

```tsx
const INITIAL_CHIPS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Production Ready",
    description: "Fully type-safe and tested",
    icon: SecurityCheckIcon,
  },
  // ... add more items
];
```

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import Bucket from "@/components/bucket";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <Bucket />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Understanding the Logic

The **Bucket** component creates a sense of depth and physical interaction using a layered SVG approach and Framer Motion's exit animations.

### 1. The Layered "Glass" Effect

The "bucket" is not a single image, but a collection of SVG paths and `foreignObject` elements stacked on top of each other:

- **Base Layer**: Defines the back and bottom of the bucket with subtle gradients.
- **Middle Layer**: Where the active `motion.div` chip resides.
- **Top Layer**: A translucent front cover with heavy `backdrop-blur`. This makes the chips appear as if they are falling _into_ a container.

### 2. The Toss Animation

The component uses `AnimatePresence` with `mode="popLayout"` to manage the lifecycle of the chips. Every 2 seconds (configurable in the `useEffect` interval), the first item is moved to the end of the array.

- **Entry (`initial`)**: The chip starts high up with `opacity: 0` and drops down.
- **Exit (`exit`)**: The chip falls further down "out" of the bucket, creating a continuous tossing effect.

### 3. High-Fidelity Filters

The component makes extensive use of SVG filters for:

- **Inner Shadows**: Giving the container edges a rounded, 3D feel.
- **Multi-stage Dropshadows**: Providing soft, realistic shadows for complex shapes.
- **Dynamic Blurs**: The front face uses a high-radius blur to create a premium glassmorphism finish.

### 4. Responsive Adaptation

Using a custom `useIsMobile` hook, the component dynamically scales the chips and adjusts the vertical travel distance of the animations. This ensures the "toss" effect doesn't overlap with other page elements on small screens.

## Features

- **Continuous Tossing**: Smooth, looping animation that keeps the user engaged.
- **Layered Depth**: True z-axis feel without using a 3D engine.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism, tailored gradients, and high-spec icons.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses CSS-accelerated SVG properties and motion values.
- **Flexible Content**: Easily swappable titles, descriptions, and icons.
